### 🧭 About Me

As a **Senior Technology Analyst at Deutsche Bank**, I specialize in building **efficient, scalable, and robust software solutions**.  
With a strong foundation in **full-stack development**, **cloud computing**, and **DevOps**, I’m driven by the opportunity to solve complex problems through technology.

I’m currently expanding my expertise in **AI, Data Science, and GCP’s Vertex AI**, exploring how **LLMs and Generative AI** can enhance software ecosystems.
